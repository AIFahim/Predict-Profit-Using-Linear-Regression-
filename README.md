## Dataset Description:
The dataset in given in this repository, but to work with the latest dataset please download dataset from the following links. <br>
1. https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset
2. https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report

After downloading the datasets, unzip them and you can see two csv files named "covid_19_clean_complete.csv" and "covid_19_data.csv". These two datasets are used in this project.

## Project Description
<!--
This is originally a kaggle competition. I tried to visualize and analyze the confirmed, death and recovery rates of various countries.
Then I tried to analyze the impacts of COVID-19 on Bangladesh by analyzing the confirmed, death and recovery graph plots and tried to predict the future rates by using Fbprophet algorithm. <br>
You may also find my notebook in kaggle. <br>

## Results
1. The percentage of Predicted recovery after confirmation is 17.53%.
2. The percentage of Predicted Death after confirmation is 1.32%.
